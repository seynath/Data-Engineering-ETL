# ✅ DAG Import Error Fixed!

## Problem
The Airflow DAG was showing import errors because Python modules were not accessible to the Airflow containers.

## Solution Applied
Copied all required Python modules to the `airflow/dags/` directory:

```bash
cp bronze_ingestion.py airflow/dags/
cp silver_transformation.py airflow/dags/
cp load_silver_to_postgres.py airflow/dags/
cp logger.py airflow/dags/
cp config_loader.py airflow/dags/
cp data_quality.py airflow/dags/
```

## Verification
```bash
$ docker-compose exec airflow-scheduler airflow dags list | grep healthcare
healthcare_etl_pipeline | healthcare_etl_dag.py | data-engineering | True
```

✅ **DAG is now loaded successfully!**

## Next Steps

### 1. Refresh Airflow UI
- Open http://localhost:8080
- The error banner should be gone
- You should see `healthcare_etl_pipeline` in the DAGs list

### 2. Trigger the Pipeline
1. Click on `healthcare_etl_pipeline`
2. Click the toggle to unpause (if paused)
3. Click the ▶️ Play button
4. Select "Trigger DAG"
5. Watch it execute!

### 3. Monitor Execution
- View the Graph to see task dependencies
- Click on tasks to view logs
- Watch tasks turn green as they complete

## Expected Pipeline Runtime
- **Total:** 10-15 minutes
- Bronze Ingestion: 1-2 min
- Silver Transformation: 2-3 min
- Load to PostgreSQL: 1-2 min
- dbt (Gold Layer): 3-5 min
- Data Quality: 1-2 min

## Troubleshooting

If you still see errors:
```bash
# Restart Airflow services
docker-compose restart airflow-scheduler airflow-webserver

# Wait 30 seconds
sleep 30

# Check for errors
docker-compose exec airflow-scheduler airflow dags list-import-errors
```

**Status:** ✅ FIXED - Ready to run the pipeline!
