# ‚úÖ dbt Dependencies Issue Fixed

## Problem
The dbt Gold layer task failed with error:
```
dbt found 1 package(s) specified in packages.yml, but only 0 package(s) installed in dbt_packages. 
Run "dbt deps" to install package dependencies.
```

## Root Cause
The dbt project requires the `dbt_utils` package (specified in `packages.yml`), but it wasn't installed in the Airflow container.

## Solution Applied
Ran `dbt deps` command inside the Airflow container to install the required packages:

```bash
docker-compose exec airflow-webserver bash -c "cd /opt/airflow/dbt_project && dbt deps --profiles-dir /opt/airflow/dbt_project"
```

## Result
‚úÖ Successfully installed `dbt-labs/dbt_utils` version 1.1.1

## What Happens Next

The pipeline will automatically retry the failed `dbt_gold_layer.dbt_run_staging` task and should now succeed.

### Expected Flow
1. ‚úÖ Bronze Ingestion - COMPLETED
2. ‚úÖ Silver Transformation - COMPLETED  
3. ‚úÖ Load to PostgreSQL - COMPLETED
4. ‚úÖ Data Quality Validation - COMPLETED (after fixes)
5. üîÑ dbt Gold Layer - RETRYING NOW
   - dbt_run_staging
   - dbt_run_dimensions
   - dbt_run_facts
   - dbt_test
6. ‚è≥ Generate Report - PENDING
7. ‚è≥ Refresh Superset - PENDING

## Monitoring

Watch the pipeline progress in Airflow UI:
- Go to http://localhost:8080
- Click on `healthcare_etl_pipeline`
- Watch the dbt tasks turn green

## What Gets Created

Once dbt completes, you'll have:

### Staging Tables (staging schema)
- stg_patients
- stg_encounters
- stg_diagnoses
- stg_procedures
- stg_medications
- stg_lab_tests
- stg_claims_and_billing
- stg_providers
- stg_denials

### Dimension Tables (dimensions schema)
- dim_patient
- dim_provider
- dim_date
- dim_diagnosis
- dim_procedure

### Fact Tables (facts schema)
- fact_encounter
- fact_claim
- fact_medication
- fact_lab_test

## Verification

After the pipeline completes, verify the tables:

```bash
# Connect to database
docker-compose exec warehouse-db psql -U etl_user -d healthcare_warehouse

# Check staging tables
\dt staging.*

# Check dimension tables
\dt dimensions.*

# Check fact tables
\dt facts.*

# Count records
SELECT 
    'dim_patient' as table_name, 
    COUNT(*) as row_count 
FROM dimensions.dim_patient
UNION ALL
SELECT 'dim_provider', COUNT(*) FROM dimensions.dim_provider
UNION ALL
SELECT 'fact_encounter', COUNT(*) FROM facts.fact_encounter
UNION ALL
SELECT 'fact_claim', COUNT(*) FROM facts.fact_claim;
```

## Status

‚úÖ **dbt dependencies installed successfully**

The pipeline should now complete end-to-end! üéâ

---

## Note for Future Runs

The dbt packages are now installed in the Airflow container and will persist for future pipeline runs. However, if you restart the containers with `docker-compose down -v` (which removes volumes), you'll need to run `dbt deps` again.

### Permanent Solution

To make this permanent, you could:
1. Add a pre-task to run `dbt deps` before dbt tasks
2. Build a custom Airflow image with dbt packages pre-installed
3. Add `dbt deps` to the container startup script

For now, the packages are installed and the pipeline will work! üöÄ
